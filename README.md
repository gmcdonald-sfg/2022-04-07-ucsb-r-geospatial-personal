# 2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial-personal

Personal repo for my teaching notes for the UCSB Carpentries course [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial/).

Data are contained in the `source_data` directory. These should be downloaded in advance of the workshop from [here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/articles/2009586/versions/10).

The code necessary for each episode is contained in 3 separate episode files.
